				<p title="About Dimple">
				Dimple is a simple discord bot created for basic tasks discord users may like to see in a bot.A lot of bots exist that can perform Dimple's functions but I made Dimple to create something of my own in a platform like discord which I use on a day to day basis. Dimple is based on the spirit from Mob 
				Psycho that accompanied the protoganist Mob.

				<p title="Dimple's Origins">
					Dimple was made using discord.py, a python library for making discord applications. Dimple was created in the discord application itself. The bot token was taken and used for running the client. Many of the functions, that Dimple can perform, were made with the aid of the 
					<a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html" target = "_blank">API's documentation</a>. Dimple was made to enhance my understand of working with APIs and also to work on a fun project. To see more of the code behind Dimple, look into source code in the sidebar.
